# How we built it
In order to support user notifications on environmental alerts, we used node-mailer in order to send personalized emails to the user. On the website interface, we also allow users to browse any potential hazards in any given location by allowing users to enter a general location using a form and showing a map in response, indicating areas of potential danger. Using react, we have also created user-friendly interfaces to provide information and guidance to users that need to know necessary safety procedures during a natural hazard. We built the overall website with a React.js frontend and express.js backend.
